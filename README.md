<h1> What is this?</h1>
<h6>This is a coding challenge given to me to test my skills in React.js. The goal of this task was to create a simple scoreboard that can track current games taking place. User can edit names and update the score throughout the game. When finished, the user can store the data and it will be displayed in another part of the main screen.</h6>

<h2> What was used to make this project happen </h2>
<h6> React.js, localstorage </h6>
</br>
<h2> How to use this app</h2>
<h6> Download this project in your local computer. Once downloaded, open the file in your local code editor. Once this is completed you'll want to open your termainal and run npm install. After this is completed, please run npm start. SUCCESS! You have a running scoreboard app.</h6>
</br>
<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
<h6>For speed I decided to store all the game data in the localstorage. If I were to make this app again, I would chose a different route such an api. The localstorage data is problematic on displaying easy to read code.  </h6>
